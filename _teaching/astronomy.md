Course Description
======

Key:  |
The class introduces a variety of topics in astronomy and astrophysics, including: the Earth and Moon system, 
the sky and seasons, basic optical instruments, the origin of the solar system, the planetary geology of the terrestrial planets, 
the outer solar system, recent scientific missions in astronomy, basic orbital mechanics, and the varieties of stars
in the universe from their births to destruction.  
Because astronomy and astrophysics are growing fields of discovery, students will investigate ongoing research at a topical level.
To prepare students for fields in science and engineering, this course will also focus on the instrumentation, techniques, 
and physics concepts which have facilitated scientific observations.  Some night time viewing may be required.
